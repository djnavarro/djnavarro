I'm a computational cognitive scientist and Associate Professor at the University of New South Wales, using a mix of experimental methods and computational modelling techniques to explore how the human mind works. Among other things I'm a cofounder of [R-Ladies Sydney](https://rladiessydney.org), hold editorial roles at [Science](https://www.sciencemag.org/) and [Psychological Review](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/rev/), and I make generative art with R.
